# AppInvoiceWinForms

Currently I work on an app for invoice. The application is wirtten in WinForms. The app is connected to the database (Entity Eramework).

The functions that the application will have are:
* Add clients
* Delete clients
* Change data 

The additional application will generate the client base for the xml file and will create a pdf file. The invoice data will be taken from the database.
